{"name":"Gcipher","body":"# gcipher\r\ngcipher is a Javascript widget to encrypt/decrypt emails in Gmail using the symmetric Blowfish cipher. The cipher itself is implemented by [Daniel Rench](https://github.com/drench). gcipher currently only works for the *Gmail web interface*. This is more of an experimental hack for me so I do not plan to expand it to other clients.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n[Button](javascript:alert\\(\"hello\"\\))\r\n\r\nTo use it, drag the button to your bookmarks. After writing an email in the Gmail web interface, click the bookmarked button to encrypt your email before sending. gcipher will ask you for a password.\r\n\r\nTo decrypt, simply open up an email from Gmail, and click the bookmarked button again, which will prompt you for the password for decryption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Is it really secure?\r\nYou use gcipher because you want your email to be _stored_ securely on Google's servers. Gmail already uses secure connection so it already prevents eavesdropping. \r\n\r\nThere are a couple shortcomings to gcipher's approach. For instance, Gmail automatically saves your email to draft before you send it, and possibly before you encrypted it. I hope to address this in a future update.","tagline":"Blowfish cipher for Gmail.
